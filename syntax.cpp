#include <iostream> // header file libary, just like normal C
using namespace std; // we use names for objects and variables in the standard libary

int main() { // exactly like main in C
  cout << "Hello World!"; // object used together with a insertion operator to output text
  // cout = see-out, output whatever its inserted in it
  // can also be writting like int main() {cout << "Hello World!"; return 0;} <- this shit isnt readable
  return 0; // same with C
} // why is everything like C

// oh wait because this is C++

//if you omitted the using namespace std, to use cout you have to "std::"cout << "Hello World"
